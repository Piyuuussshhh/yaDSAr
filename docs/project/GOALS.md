My implementation of all data containers.
Eventually, I want the containers to be as efficient as possible, ie, cache-friendly.

Essentially, I'm sortof reimplementing the standard template library. Maybe I can get hold of the specifications and build this project accordingly. Right now, the only reason I started working on this project was to master DSA.
But I now see the potential this project has. Will start work towards this immediately.

Chasing optimization at all possible avenues is quite possibly the greatest skill a developer can possess.
My goal with this project is to train myself to achieve high levels of optimization across all projects I will take part in.
