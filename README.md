<h1>Yet Another Data Structures and Algorithms Repository.</h1>
<b>My personal reimplementation of the Standard Template Library for data structures and algorithms I use regularly </b> (but I initially started this to practice DSA interview questions).<br><br>
I know the name is goofy, but I've had so many attempts at writing a legit DSA repo, it's funny. The inspiration for the name came from the yacc tool I learnt in compiler design class, which stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc">Yet Another Compiler-Compiler</a>.
