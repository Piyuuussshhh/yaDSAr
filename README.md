###### ... but I initially started this to practice DSA for interviews.
I know the name is goofy, but I've had so many attempts at writing a legit DSA repo, it's funny. The inspiration for the name came from the yacc tool I learnt in compiler design class, which stands for [Yet Another Compiler Compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc).
